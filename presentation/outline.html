		<h1> Test-driven development Tech Meeting</h1>

		<h2> What is TTD? What is a test?</h2>
		<h4> I think of tests as automatic, preemptive debugging.</br>
			How many times have we written code and put in a console.log
			(or println or whatever) to figure out whats going on?</h4>

		<h4>If you have ever done this, you have written a test. Congrats.</h4>

		<h4>But what if instead of waiting for a bug to occur and THEN
			writing those tests, you wrote them in advance?</h4>

		<h4>Not only would you understand the code you are writing better,
			you could catch bugs before they ever happen</h4>

		<h4>This is <em>Test-Driven</em> Development</h4>
		</hr>

		<h4>For this talk I am going to go through the basics of unit
		unit tests, assertions. Using the book Test-Driven Javascript Development
		by Christian Johnsen. Then...</h4>


		<ul>
			<li>Manually checking code in console</br>
			   <ul>
					 <li>Not Automated</li>
					 <li>Requires investigation + repeated manual labor</li>
				 </ul>
			</li></br>

			<li>Ok, so lets at the very least copy our test into a basic html file (HTML test page)
				<ul>
					<li>Now its reproducible!</li>
				</ul>
			</li></br>

			<li>Assertions
				<ul>
					<li>The most important part</li>
					<li>This requires the most thought and forces us to define state &amp; expectations. </li>
					<li>Assertions are the heart of why TTD can help us craft better code</li>
					<li>An assestion is used to perform checks</li>
					<li>"I expect for a date Jan 25 1989 <code>date.strfttime(%d)</code> to return <code>25"</code></li>
					<li>"I expect the button to turn blue when I click it</li>
				</ul>
			</li></br>

			<li>1.2 What does an assertion function have? (show code)
				<ul>
					<li>message --> "It should equal 5"</li>
					<li>throw statement to throw and error if the assertion is false</li>
					<li>counter to keep track of number of tests ran</li>
				</ul>
			</li></br>

			<li>What does this look like?
				<ul>
					<li>A bunch of assert statements</li>
				</ul>
			</li></br>

			<li>Test functions, Cases, Suites
				<ul>
					<li>message --> "It should equal 5"</li>
				</ul>
			</li></br>
