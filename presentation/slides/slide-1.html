    1. Today I'm going to go over basics of unit testing in Javascript.</br>
    2. This is not a new topic. This presentation should hopefully be a nice
    review for people, an introduction to those not familar (maybe QA), and
    a learning process for me.
    3. What I want to show is:</br>
        - a bit of the code behind framworks </br>
        - some javascript frameworks </br>
        - some features &amp; and vocabulary of testing </br>
    4. Get people (on all teams) thinking about
    how we can use testing in our upcoming projects.
