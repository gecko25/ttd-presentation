      <li>TDD starts with tests</li>
      <li>Make a new object, function, etc.</li>
      <li>Write the tests for them, watch them fail (bc nothing exists yet!).</li>
      <li>Fill in with code, watch tests pass.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>BDD doesn't start with tests</li>
      <li>BDD doesn't necessarily test everything in an application</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Both should test small units.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <h4>EXAMPLE: writing a calculator</h4>
      <li>test addition of positive numbers</li>
      <li>test addition of neg numbers</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>TDD IMO is better.</li>
      <li>Forces you to think before about logic only, NOT implementation.</li>
      <li>Guaruntees there are always tests &amp; better code coverage</li>
    </ul>
