    We have gone over what a basic unit test is.
    Now let's talk about Test Driven Development.
    <ul>
      <li>Rather than focusing on the code to make something work,
        TTD starts by defining the end goal. Shifting a the focus
      to the logic of the problem vs what framework to use etc.</li>
      <li>Heavy focus on units in isolation == less bugs, less redundant code</li>
      <li>Helps with design bc we are always
        thinking in terms of use cases in unit tests</li>
    </ul>
