    So, before we actually do anything code-wise, we need to think: </br>
    1. What is our assumed state?</br>
    2. What is our expected output going to be based on this assumed state?</br>

    So, here our assumed state is given a date object January 25, 1989
    and the formater '%m', we expect a string output of '01', and same with %F.</br>

    Okay, so how do we check this?

  <h3>How do we test this method?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>What is our assumed state?</li>
    <li>What do we expect our output to be based on our assumed state?</li>
  </ul>

  <pre><code>var mybirthday = new Date(1989, 0, 25);
mybirthday.strftime('%m');  //"01"
mybirthday.strftime('%F');  //"1989-01-25"</pre></code>
